- What Type Of Thinker Are You: Architect Or Gardener
- What Thinking Style Are You? Architect Or Gardener

Are you an Architect or a Gardener?
- Architects are top-down thinkers that prioritize **order** and **structure**.
- Gardeners are bottom-up thinkers that prioritize **chaos** and **curiosity.**

In our problem solving and thinking efforts we move between these two thinking styles, but we each have a natural tendency. The problem comes when we don’t know which thinking style we lean towards. It’s then we force ourselves to think in ways which feel inauthentic, difficult, and frustrating.

When we understand both, we can lean into the one we love while recognizing the power of the other to supercharge our creativity. 

Architects like categorizing and using the big picture to further their decision-making and sensemaking. They are good organizers and benefit from having a few lists to guide their actions. They naturally prefer knowing more about a subject or situation before they act—even if that stymies action.

“There are two types of writers, the architects and the gardeners. The architects plan everything ahead of time… The gardeners dig a hole, drop in a seed, and water it.” - George R.R Martin. 

%%I think we should include some examples of people that are classically architects or gardeners. It will connect people with the idea and give more clarity on what it means. You’re an architect. So we should bring you in. But we could also show Brandon Sanderson as a architect and Steven King as a gardener for example.%%

## How do you know which one you are? 

Here is the easiest way to determine your natural thinking style. When you are in the early stages of a new work…

Do you know the end of your story?

If so, you are likely a natural architect. 
If not, you might be a natural gardener.

## Unhealthy Tendencies Of Architects And Gardeners

When you lean too far into your architect, your thinking becomes **fragile**:

%%We could use your brainstorm session with Pink gloves boxing as an example of what can happen when you are too much of an architect when you should be a gardener?%%

You’re organizing the organization of the organization. 

There’s no sense of flow, rhythm, spontaneity. It feels like your in a straitjacket, but you aren’t Houdini. 

You get stuck in architect work, creating blueprints for castles in the clouds.

When you lean too far into your gardener personality, your thinking becomes **scattered:**

You know what this feels like. You open up YouTube to “watch that one video you had in watch later” only to wake up three hours later watching cat videos on the other side of YouTube. You go down a million different rabbit holes. 

You get lost in the forest. You’re overwhelmed and you shamefully abandon your work. 
When you spend all your time in gardening mode, you **don’t get anything done.** 

## Healthy Architect And Gardening Behavior

When you lean into your architect personality in a healthy way you unlock **convergent thinking:**

When you lean into your gardener personality in a healthy way you unlock **divergent thinking:**

## How To Switch Between Architect And Gardening To Maximize Creativity
When you get stuck on a project—bored, confused, frustrated, overwhelmed—it’s often a **sign you need to switch modes.**

By weaving micro and macro, you will break through sticking points, stay engaged with material longer, and create more meaningful work then you ever would sticking to one style alone. 

## How To Switch Between Modes To Supercharge Creativity
The key is to switch modes when you feel stuck. 

If you’re stuck in the weeds, take off your gardener's hat and build some perspective by creating a rough Map of Content.

- Assemble everything you’ve been capturing, writing, and thinking about.
- Look for the larger picture as an Architect

If you’re lost in abstraction, stop building unearned structure and get your hands dirty.

- Dive into a specific note and just start writing.
- Gardening

There is an art to moving between Architect and Gardener. Once you get a feel for it, you'll have a skill to break through sticking points and continue making meaningful progress.

## Working Through And Going Around

### If you’re working through score is higher than your going around 

Healthy tendency: You are comfortable going deep into an effort. Four-hour hyper-focused sprints are not uncommon. It's a gift; and you are able to get huge swaths of work during these times. The question is, do you know when your superpower is working against you?

Unhealthy tendency: When taken too far, your tendency for working through problems can lead to what friends and family might call "being stubborn again". In these moments, a tremendous amount of energy often goes to solving a problem that would be much better solved by walking away from it and allowing a new perspective to gently enter your mind. But it means letting go. Can you let go?

### If you’re working through score is lower than you’re going around score:

Healthy tendency: You enjoy getting different perspectives, and don't have a need to overly control situations. If you are facing a brick wall, you don't waste time and energy hammering through it; you walk around it. You can easily be a team player who asks others for opinions. The question is, does your tendency to indirectly tackle problems result in foisting too much responsibility on others?

Unhealthy tendency: When taken too far, your tendency to go around a problem can manifest as simply avoiding the problem. You might start a new project or effort. You might find several new hobbies. Be aware of these forms of "productive procrastination", as too much is a sign that there is something else you're avoiding.
