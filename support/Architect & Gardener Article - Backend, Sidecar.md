- What Type Of Thinker Are You: Architect Or Gardener
- What Thinking Style Are You? Architect Or Gardener

Are you an Architect or a Gardener?
- Architects are top-down thinkers that prioritize **order** and **structure**.
- Gardeners are bottom-up thinkers that prioritize **chaos** and **curiosity.**

In our problem solving and thinking efforts we move between these two thinking styles, but we each have a natural tendency. The problem comes when we don’t know which thinking style we lean towards. It’s then we force ourselves to think in ways which feel inauthentic, difficult, and frustrating.

When we understand both, we can lean into the one we love while recognizing the power of the other to supercharge our creativity. 

“There are two types of writers, the architects and the gardeners. The architects plan everything ahead of time… The gardeners dig a hole, drop in a seed, and water it.” - George R.R Martin.

Architects like categorizing and using the big picture to further their decision-making and sensemaking. They are good organizers and benefit from having a few lists to guide their actions. They naturally prefer knowing more about a subject or situation before they act—even if that stymies action.

%%I think we should include some examples of people that are classically architects or gardeners. It will connect people with the idea and give more clarity on what it means. You’re an architect. So we should bring you in. But we could also show Brandon Sanderson as a architect and Steven King as a gardener for example.%%
### How do you know which one you are? 

Here is the easiest way to determine your natural thinking style. When you are in the early stages of a new work…

Do you know the end of your story?

If so, you are likely a natural architect. 
If not, you might be a natural gardener.

## Unhealthy Tendencies Of Architects And Gardeners

%%We could use your brainstorm session with Pink loves boxing as an example of what can happen when you are too much of an architect when you should be a gardener?%%

## How To Switch Between Architect And Gardening To Maximize Creativity
When you get stuck on a project—bored, confused, frustrated, overwhelmed—it’s often a **sign you need to switch modes.**

By weaving micro and macro, you will break through sticking points, stay engaged with material longer, and create more meaningful work then you ever would sticking to one style alone. 

### Which Thinking Mode Is Better?
Each mode has advantages and disadvantages.

Architects prefer seeing "the big picture" to further their decision-making and sensemaking.

They are good organizers and benefit from having a few lists to guide their actions. But left unchecked, their need to know everything about a subject or situation can stymie action.

Gardeners are comfortable without a complete
high-level picture. They can work effectively with
limited information.

Left unchecked, their interests become become
rabbit holes—disorienting them from making
clear progress.

### How To Switch Between Modes To Supercharge Creativity
The key is to switch modes when you feel stuck. 

If you’re stuck in the weeds, take off your gardener's hat and build some perspective by creating a rough Map of Content.

- Assemble everything you’ve been capturing, writing, and thinking about.
- Look for the larger picture as an Architect

If you’re lost in abstraction, stop building unearned structure and get your hands dirty.

- Dive into a specific note and just start writing.
- Gardening

There is an art to moving between Architect and Gardener. Once you get a feel for it, you'll have a skill to break through sticking points and continue making meaningful progress.
