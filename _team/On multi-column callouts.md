you cannot set up a 2x2 unless you have something in between the callout groups  
  
This is either a <br/> html tag or an empty quote line >  
  
You can see examples in the note [[../notes/Test note|Test note]], and you can see how it is rendered on the website for reference
## Steps
- Add `cssclasses` property to the note and add the value `grid`
- Create 3 callouts in a row, with the middle one being of type `![EMPTY]`
## Example
```
> [!NOTE] Callout 1
> Contents

> [!EMPTY] 

> [!INFO] aldjalksd
> asldkjaslkdjaskldjasldkj

```

> [!NOTE] Callout 1
> Contents

> [!EMPTY] 

> [!INFO] aldjalksd
> asldkjaslkdjaskldjasldkj
