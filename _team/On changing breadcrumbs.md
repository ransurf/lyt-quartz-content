Use two fields:
- `breadcrumbLabel` is for the label you want the breadcrumb to have
- `breadcrumbPath` is for the path you want to go to
	- be sure to have slash as a prefix!
	- `/index` is for home page

## Uses
Right now mostly used for overriding the breadcrumbs of folder notes like [[../essays/index|essays]] to redirect them back to the home note
