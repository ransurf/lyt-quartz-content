## Displaying
Two ways for it to render:

### Default
First option is to use the default one:
- add frontmatter `ctaType` and set value to `default`
- Note that if you have an empty field it will probably be used, so just delete it entirely
- This is for a simple CTA you can add to any note to get them to try out the LYT primer. To override, you can also include the desired fields in the second option

### Custom
Second option is to set up the following metadata:
- `ctaTitle`
- `ctaButton`
- `ctaFormId`
