- Clone the quartz repo locally using a git client (cli, githubdesktop, etc) somewhere onto your computer
- Make sure you have permission to push commits you make locally too
- In Enveloppe's Github config settings page, toggle test mode on
- "Publish" the files you want into the test folder (default is github-publisher but you can change it on the same page)
- Once "published", open the vault in explorer and copy all the files in the test folder into the quartz's content folder
- Now commit all the newly added files using your git client, and push them to the repo
- Now you're done!!

## Knowing
1. It's as easy as right clicking the public folder you have and hit _add props_, and then checking the checkbox will let you immediately set them all to True!! After this I recommend setting a global (or per-folder) Template with the templater plugin and add the share key to that (with the default set to false, of course, just to be safe) Also ALSO while I'm suggesting plugins that work really well with Enveloppe (or any publishing framework), I also really love [**supercharged links **](obsidian://show-plugin?id=supercharged-links-obsidian) and [**Colorful Note Borders**](obsidian://show-plugin?id=colorful-note-borders) Supercharged links allows you to change the style of links to your notes (and in the folder view as well, depending on your theme) based on your note properties and tags, and colorful note borders adds a colored border also based on your note's properties I love it cos I keep personal and public notes in the same vault, so I like to know at a glance if something is a public facing file or not!
