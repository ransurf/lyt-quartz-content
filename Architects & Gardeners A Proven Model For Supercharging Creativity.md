> “There are two types of writers, the architects and the gardeners. The architects plan everything ahead of time… The gardeners dig a hole, drop in a seed, and water it.” - George R.R Martin. 

Architects are top-down thinkers that prioritize **order** and **structure**. 

They prefer working with the end in mind. Brandon Sanderson—popular fantasy author of the Stormlight Archive and Mistborn series—is a great example of an architect. His  outlines could be novels in themselves.
%%If you want to use a different example then Brandon Sanderson go ahead. he’s Just familiar to me and I think having some examples early on will give people clarity over what architects and gardeners are like.%%
Gardeners are bottom-up thinkers that prioritize **chaos** and **curiosity.** 

They prefer working by planting seeds and letting them grow over time. Steven King is a great example of a gardener. He loves writing with a compelling character or situation—a “seed”—and lets the narrative unfold as he writes. 

Architects and gardeners don’t just exist in the literary scene—they’re everywhere.

In all our problem solving and thinking efforts we move between these two thinking styles, but we all have a natural tendency. The problem comes when we don’t know which thinking style we lean towards. It’s then we force ourselves to think in ways which feel inauthentic, difficult, and frustrating.

### **When we understand not only our natural thinking style, but how to switch in between them, we can supercharge our creativity.**

I used to lean way too heavily into my architect side. For years I used the notetaking app Evernote to grow, develop, and manage a fitness boxing business as well as act and produce two indie films. The issue was Evernote relied too heavily on folders and I couldn’t link notes together to form novel insights. 

In effect, my gardener side was being strangled.

Ironically, I naturally lean more towards architect, but Evernote took it too far. After 5 years, opening Evernote was no longer fun. Just the thought of opening it created surprising amounts of anxiety.

Once I switched to the linked based notetaking app Obsidian it felt like a massive weight was lifted off my shoulders. I was free. Suddenly, I could explore both my architect and gardening side in tandem, boosting my creativity. 

### How do you know which one you are? 

Here is the easiest way to determine your natural thinking style. When you are in the early stages of a new work, do you know the end of your story?

If yes, you are likely a natural architect. 

If not, you are likely a natural gardener.

Knowing your natural thinking style is a valuable insight in itself. You now know which thinking style you should lean towards. But you have to be careful.

There is danger in leaning too far into either thinking style. 

## Unhealthy Tendencies Of Architects And Gardeners

When you lean too far into your architect, your thinking becomes **fragile**: %%Thoughts on using these images from your presentation in the piece? They have quiet a bit of text on them so I don’t know if readers will want to read through.%%

%%I need an example story we might be able to use to flesh out this unhealthy tendency. Perhaps your brainstorm session with Pink loves boxing as an example of what can happen when you are too much of an architect when you should be a gardener?%%

When you lean too heavily into architect, you can get stuck organizing the organization of the organization. There’s no sense of flow, rhythm, spontaneity. It feels like your in a straitjacket, but you aren’t Houdini. 

When you lean too far into your gardener personality, your thinking becomes **scattered:**

%%Another possible example story could go here%%

You know what this feels like. You open up YouTube to “watch that one video you had in watch later” only to wake up three hours later on a video titled “cute cat and puppy.” You go down rabbit holes in your rabbit holes. Overwhelmed you shamefully abandon your work. 

Funnily enough, in either case—leaning too much into gardener or too much into architect—**don’t get anything done.** 

Over architecting you spend so much time planning you don’t act. Over gardening you get so lost in the forest, you forget the way back to civilization. 

There must be a better way…

## Healthy Architect And Gardening Behavior

When you lean into your architect personality in a healthy way you unlock **convergent thinking:**

Having a more healthy tendency with your natural thinking style is a great first step. But if you truly want to supercharge your creativity, you need to learn how to switch between both thinking styles. 

## How To Switch Between Architect And Gardening To Maximize Creativity
When you get stuck on a project—bored, confused, frustrated, overwhelmed—it’s often a **sign you need to switch thinking styles.**

By weaving architect and gardener, you will break through sticking points, stay engaged with material longer, and create more meaningful work then you ever would sticking to one style alone. 

*How do you know which thinking cap to put on? 

If you feel rigid, restless, or stifled, it’s probably a sign you need to take off your architect’s hat and put on your gardener. 

What you do depends on the creative work you are doing but here are a few ideas:
- Dive into a specific note and just start writing.
- Ask yourself some questions and see where they take you. 
- Consume some information to get ideas.
- Take a walk or break (perhaps some Breadth Of The Wild—it’s one of my favorites)

If you feel scatter brained, overwhelmed, or lost, it’s probably a sign you need to take off your gardener's hat and put on your architect.

Here’s a few ideas for how you could do this:
- Assemble everything you’ve been capturing, writing, and thinking about into a map.
- Clarify what the larger goal of your work is
- Get an outside perspective on your work by asking a colleague or friend

There is an art to moving between Architect and Gardener. A Yin and Yang. We all have a natural thinking tendency—which we should use as a strength—but we must also learn to switch between them. 

Once you get a feel for it, you'll have a skill to break through sticking points and continue making meaningful progress.

*So, which thinking cap will you be wearing now?*
