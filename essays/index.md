Let’s explore the concept of the essay.

Originating from the French word "essayer," meaning "to try" or "to attempt," the essay is fundamentally an exploration of ideas. The form was pioneered by Michel de Montaigne in the late 16th century when he published a collection titled "Essais," which were extensive reflections on his personal experiences, thoughts, and beliefs. Through these writings, Montaigne used the essay as a tool to examine and question the world, making the form synonymous with introspective inquiry and thoughtful expression.
